# Node.js Queryable Encryption Tutorial

- This project demonstrates an example implementation of Queryable Encryption for the MongoDB Node.js driver, including examples of Equality and Range queries.
- This content has been modified and enhanced to enable Range Queries based on the following:
[MongoDB University - Queryable Encryption Examples](https://github.com/mongodb-university/docs-in-use-encryption-examples/tree/main/queryable-encryption) 
- To learn more about Queryable Encryption, see the [[Queryable Encryption section]](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/) in the Server manual.
